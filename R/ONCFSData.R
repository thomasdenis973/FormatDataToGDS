#' Observations of a monkey species across 29 sites in French Guiana.
#'
#' A dataset containing the observations of a monkey species recorded
#' according to ONCFS sampling design. When no species or individual was observed on the subsample,
#'   a row was added. See details below.

#' @format A data frame with 707 rows and 8 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{date}{date of the observation}
#'   \item{number}{number of individual observed in the field}
#'   \item{precisely_counted}{"oui", when the group size had been precisely counted. Otherwise, "non}
#'   \item{distance}{perpendicular distance}
#'   \item{effort}{distance walked on the subsample (e.g., a transect)}
#'   \item{direction}{direction walked on the subsample}
#'   \item{site}{site name}
#'   \item{remarque}{"transect vide" significates that no species or individual was observed on the subsample.
#'   In this case, a row was added with sampling effort (and also date, direction and site) to take into account
#'   the "empty" subsample in the calculation of the sampling effort of the sample.
